            <p>One of the best features about Minimalist Baker from food stylist and photographer Dana Shultz is that
                the recipes themselves are simple and easy to make. At least one of the following qualifiers is true for
                each recipe: takes no more than 30 minutes, requires just one bowl, and includes 10 ingredients or
                fewer.</p>
